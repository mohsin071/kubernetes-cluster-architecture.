# Kubernetes Cluster Architecture

This repository provides an overview of the architectural concepts behind Kubernetes. A Kubernetes cluster consists of a control plane and a set of worker nodes that run containerized applications.

## Key Concepts

- **Control Plane**: Manages the worker nodes and Pods in the cluster.
- **Worker Nodes**: Host the Pods that comprise the application workload.

## Components

- [Control Plane Components](components/control_plane.md)
- [Node Components](components/node_components.md)
- [Addons](components/addons.md)
- [Architecture Variations](components/architecture_variations.md)
